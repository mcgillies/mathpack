# mathpack

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mathpack is to provide basic mathematical functions so the
user does not have to use the “+” and “-” keys as they are far away from
the general hand position when typing

## Installation

You can install the development version of mathpack from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcgillies/mathpack")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(mathpack)
add(1,2)
#> [1] 3
subtract(10000,45678.595)
#> [1] -35678.6
## basic example code
